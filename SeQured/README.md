# This is the readme file for NYUAD Hackathon 2022 for group SeQure 


# Background:

With the increasing risk of cybersecurity looming over, SeQured uses quantum randomness to anonymize medical data. The aim is to maintain the privacy of the patient's medical data, while at the same time enabling the ability of sharing it with medical practitioners in an easy and secure way. SeQured uses the Electrocardiogram as a use case to demonstrate the added value of the solution.


# 1: Quantum Randomness Sub-system:

	- Quantum Randomness sub-system: The quantum randomness sub-system uses the quantum randomness feature in order to generate unique random seeds to anonymize an ECG signal.
	


# 2: Coding Electrodiagram Signals with QR Codes

	- The ECG signal anonymizer sub-system: For demonstration purposes, the ECG signal anonymizer sub-system simulates the ECG waveform. It then uses Fast Fourier Transformation to transform the ECG signal into a frequency domain for easier manipulation. Once the ECG is transformed, it is then converted into bytes and encoded on base64. This will encode the binary data into the appropriate characters for ASCII. This is then integrated into a QR code for easier sharing with medical practitioners.

	- Intergrating Quantum Randomness into ECG's

		- The Medical Interface: the platform where the system re-creates the original signal for the patient/medical practitioner from the data encoded in the created QR code. This will enable easier access to the medical record.

	- the ECG distortion:

	- Float trandformation:
